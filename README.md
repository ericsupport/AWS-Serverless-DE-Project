# AWS-Serverless-DE-Project
This is a serverless data engineering project I built with Python, SQL and AWS. I automated an API call to collect public weather data (Key metrics here were daily high, average, and rainfall) and visualize it in a Grafana dashboard. I work for a large tourist attraction. and these weather metrics can explain changes in monthly visitation.
